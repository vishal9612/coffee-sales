The Coffee Sales Analysis project focuses on uncovering customer purchasing patterns and sales trends using a dataset of coffee sales from a vending machine. The dataset spans from March 2024 to the present and contains daily transaction details, including dates, payment types, coffee types, and sales amounts. Using tools like Machine Learning (ML), SQL, and Excel, the project involves time series exploratory data analysis to identify key trends, such as peak sales times, most popular coffee types, and seasonal variations. Predictive modeling is applied to forecast future sales on daily, weekly, and monthly levels while also analyzing specific customer purchase behaviors. Key findings reveal that Latte and Americano with Milk are the most popular and high-revenue products, with peak sales occurring at 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Additionally, specific coffee types, such as Cappuccino and Hot Chocolate, show increased demand during evening hours. The insights derived from this analysis help optimize inventory planning, vending machine layouts, and restocking schedules, ultimately aiding in better decision-making and enhancing operational efficiency.
